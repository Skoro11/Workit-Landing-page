# Workit-Landing-page
This is a challenge from Frontend mentor, simple landing page with responsivenes and few hover animations. This project has a goal of making me more comfortable with writing HTML and CSS.
Any suggestions are welcome, i believe there are a lot of other ways to make this better and faster but for now main thing is to make it work.
